# Trakt for Alfred
*Trakt for Alfred* is a workflow for [Alfred v2] that allows you to search for movies and tv shows on [trakt.tv], check out current trends and manage your personal libraries. 

### Under Construction
I'm currently in the process of porting everything to trakt.tv API v2. At the end of June v1 will be disabled. I'm hoping to provide a new version until then.

### Version
2.0.0 beta

### Thanks
