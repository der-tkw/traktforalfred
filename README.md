# Trakt for Alfred
*Trakt for Alfred* is a workflow for [Alfred v2] that enables you to list trending shows/movies and search for shows or movies on [trakt.tv]. 

### Features

 - Display movie summary (basic stuff, release date, main cast, stats, trailer etc.)
 - Display list of cast members (both tv shows and movies)
 - Display a complete episode guide (shows only)
 - Navigate between summary, cast members and episode list

### Notes
 - You need a trakt.tv account for this workflow. Get your personal [API key from trakt.tv] and register it with the following command: `apikey <your-api-key-here>`. Otherwise this workflow will not function.

### Usage
