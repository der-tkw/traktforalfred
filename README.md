Trakt for Alfred is a workflow for Alfred 2.0. You can list current trends from trakt.tv or search for specific tv shows.

For each show you can display a summary (basic stuff, latest episode, network info, stats, a few links etc.), a list of cast members and a complete episode guide. Navigation between summary, cast list and episode list is possible.

Notes: You will need a trakt.tv account for this workflow to work. First thing would be search your personal API key from tract (Profile -> Settings -> API) and register it with the command `apikey`.
